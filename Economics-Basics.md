## 2.1 **Fundamental concepts**

1. Scarcity: Resources are limited, and therefore, we cannot have everything we want. Choices must be made about what goods and services to produce and consume.

1. Opportunity cost: The cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative forgone. Opportunity cost is a key concept in economics because it helps explain why people and firms make the choices they do.

1. Supply and demand: The supply of a good or service is the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at a given price, while demand is the quantity that consumers are willing and able to buy at a given price. Prices are determined by the interaction between supply and demand.

1. Market equilibrium: The price and quantity at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded is called market equilibrium. Prices will adjust until equilibrium is reached, and any shortage or surplus will be eliminated.

1. Elasticity: Elasticity measures the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. For example, price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded changes in response to changes in price.

1. Production and costs: Firms produce goods and services using inputs such as labor, capital, and materials. The costs of production depend on the prices of inputs and the production technology.

1. Market structures: Market structure refers to the degree of competition in a market. Perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly are the four main market structures.

1. Macroeconomics: Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole, focusing on issues such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, and international trade.

1. Microeconomics: Microeconomics studies the behavior of individuals and firms in the market, including issues such as consumer behavior, production, costs, and market structure.
